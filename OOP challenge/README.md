# 🐶 Python OOP Challenge: Build Your Own Digital Pet

# 🧠 Objective

To Create a class called Pet with the following:

# Attributes:

1. name: the name of your pet
2. hunger: an integer representing hunger level (0 = full, 10 = very hungry)
3. energy: an integer representing energy level (0 = tired, 10 = fully rested)
4. happiness: an integer (0–10)

# Methods:

1. eat(): reduces hunger by 3 points (but not below 0), and increases happiness by 1.
2. sleep(): increases energy by 5 points (but not above 10).
3. play(): decreases energy by 2, increases happiness by 2, and increases hunger by 1.
4. get_status(): prints the current state of the pet.

# Bonus 🎯

1. Add a method train(trick) that teaches your pet a new trick and stores it in a list.
2. Add a method show_tricks() that prints all learned tricks.

# Output
